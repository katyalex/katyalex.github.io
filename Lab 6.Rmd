```{r, echo = F,  fig.align = 'center'}
stats <- data.frame(matrix(ncol=3,
                           nrow=2, 
                           dimnames=list(NULL, 
                                        c('Variable',
                                          'Quantitative', 
                                          'Categorical'))))

stats[1, 1] = "Quantitative"
stats[2, 1] = "Categorical"
stats[1, 2] = "Scatter plot"
stats[2, 2] = "Box plot, bar chart"
stats[1, 3] = "Box plot, bar chart"
stats[2, 3] = "Table or bar chart"

library(kableExtra)
stats %>%
  kbl(digits=4) %>%
   kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

Today we will cover bivariate graph for quantitative- quantitative variables only

## Scatter plot 

To visualize the relationships between two quantitative variables type: 

```{r, eval=F}
plot(x, y) #x and y are names for your variables
```

The plot() command in R is a generic plot command that can actually produce many kinds of plots (e.g., distribution function)


## Scatter plot

There are many options in `plot()`:
```{r, eval = F}
plot(x, y, main = "This is the main title") #set the main title
plot(x, y, xlab = "This is the x-axis title") #set the x-axis title
plot(x, y, ylab = "This is the y-axis title" ) #set the y-axis title
plot(x, y, col = "red" ) #Color of dots in the scatter plot
plot(x, y, pch = 0) #Different dot shapes in the scatter plot; This should be an integer from 0 to 25. If you don’t type the pch option, R would use the default value of 1 in pch option
```


```{r, echo = F, out.width="60%",  fig.align = 'center', warning=F}
x = rnorm(1000, 10, 2)
y = x*2+rnorm(1000, 1, 2)
plot(x, y, main = "This is the main title", 
     xlab = "This is the x-axis title", 
     ylab = "This is the y-axis title", 
     col = "red", 
     pch = 0)
```

## Scatter plot

To combine multiple options, you just need to put all the options you want within the parentheses:


_Example: I want to specify the main title, x-axis title, and y-axis title in the scatter plot_

```{r, echo = T, out.width="60%",  fig.align = 'center', warning=F, eval=F}
plot(x, y, main = "This is the main title", 
     xlab = "This is the x-axis title", 
     ylab = "This is the y-axis title", 
     col = "red", 
     pch = 0)
```


## Save the plot as separate file

1. right click the plot-->copy and paste it to other programs (e.g., Microsoft Word) --> save as a new file

2. Use the `png()` function and the `dev.off()` function:

_Example: I want to save the scatter plot as a separate png file called scatter.png_

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
#Three separate lines of code (they have to be in this order!)

#It asks R to create a new png file called scatter.png in the working directory 
#with the dimension of 1200X800. All the graphs produced after this line of code
#will be put into the scatter.png file. 
#(you can think of this as a “start recording button”)
png('scatter.png', width = 1200, height = 800) 

#The second line is just the usual scatter plot function
plot(x,y) 

#The third line is the dev.off() function. 
#You don’t need to put anything within the parentheses. 
#Any graphs produced between the first line (png() function) 
#and this line will be put into the scatter.png file (“stop recording button”)
dev.off()
```

## Sampling

*Why sample?*: 

We cannot ask every single person in our population (let's say we are interested in income distribution of all USA residents (~350 million people))

Then, we need to ***cheat***

Is it legit? Yes! 

Why? Due to the properties of the ***Central Limit Theorem***!

One condition: ***sample must be random*** to ensure that our sample ***represents*** the population (=resembles)

## Population vs. Sample vs. Sampling distribution

***Population***: The whole group of people you want to know

***Sample***: Part of the group of people you want to know

***Sampling***: The process to select/pick a sample

## Population vs. Sample vs. Sampling distribution

```{r, echo = F, out.width="60%",  fig.align = 'center', warning=F, eval=T}

population = rchisq(1000000, 10, 2)
sample = sample(population, 1000)
means = c()
for (i in 1:100) {
  
  sampl = sample(population, 1000)
  means[i] = mean(sampl)

}

stats <- data.frame(matrix(ncol=4,
                           nrow=2, 
                           dimnames=list(NULL, 
                                        c('Properties',
                                          'Population', 
                                          'Sample',
                                          'Sampling'))))

stats[1, 1] = "Mean"
stats[2, 1] = "Standard Deviation"
stats[1, 2] = paste(round(mean(population), digits = 2))
stats[1, 3] = paste(round(mean(sample), digits = 2))
stats[1, 4] = paste(round(mean(means), digits = 2))
stats[2, 2] = paste(round(sd(population), digits = 2))
stats[2, 3] = paste(round(sd(sample), digits = 2))
stats[2, 4] = paste(round(sd(means), digits = 2))

library(kableExtra)
stats %>%
  kbl(digits=4) %>%
   kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")

par(mfrow=c(1,3))

hist(population, 
     main = "Distribution of Hourly salary \n of all USA residents", 
     xlab = "",
     ylab = "")
abline(v = mean(population), col="red", lwd = 2)
abline(v = sd(population), col="green", lwd = 2)

hist(sample, main = "Distribution of Hourly salary \n from one random sample (n=1000)", 
     xlab = "",
     ylab = "")
abline(v = mean(sample), col="red", lwd = 2)
abline(v = sd(sample), col="green", lwd = 2)

hist(means, main = "Sampling distribution of means \n of 100 random samples (n=1000) \n derived from population distribution", 
     xlab = "",
     ylab = "")
abline(v = mean(means), col="red", lwd = 2)
abline(v = sd(means), col="green", lwd = 2)


```


## Sampling

As you can see, if the sample is random, it's mean is close to the population mean

How close?

• According to law of large numbers, if you have large sample size, the sample mean should be close to the population mean


• The larger the sample size, the closer the sample mean with the population mean


```{r, echo = F, out.width="40%",  fig.align = 'center', warning=F, eval=T}
par(mfrow=c(1,3))

hist(population, 
     main = "Distribution of Hourly salary \n of all USA residents", 
     xlab = "",
     ylab = "")
abline(v = mean(population), col="red", lwd = 2)
abline(v = sd(population), col="green", lwd = 2)

hist(sample, main = "Distribution of Hourly salary \n from one random sample (n=1000)", 
     xlab = "",
     ylab = "")
abline(v = mean(sample), col="red", lwd = 2)
abline(v = sd(sample), col="green", lwd = 2)

hist(means, main = "Sampling distribution of means \n of 100 random samples (n=1000) \n derived from population distribution", 
     xlab = "",
     ylab = "")
abline(v = mean(means), col="red", lwd = 2)
abline(v = sd(means), col="green", lwd = 2)



```


## Central Limit Theorem

As number of samples increase, the *sampling* distribution of *means* is approximately normal. ***Also, as the number of samples increasing, the mean of the sampling distribution approaches to the population mean.***

*Note: n should be large enough (30+)*

## Central Limit Theorem 

No matter how skewed or weird the original distribution is, the sampling distribution would still be approximately normal:

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="60%",  fig.align = 'center'}
population = rchisq(1000000, 10, 2)
sample = sample(population, 1000)
means = c()
for (i in 1:100) {
  
  sampl = sample(population, 1000)
  means[i] = mean(sampl)

}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))

hist(population, 
     main = "Original population distribution", 
     xlab = "",
     ylab = "")
abline(v = mean(population), col="red", lwd = 2)
abline(v = sd(population), col="green", lwd = 2)

hist(means, main = "Sampling distribution of means \n of 100 random samples (n=1000) \n derived from population distribution", 
     xlab = "",
     ylab = "")
abline(v = mean(means), col="red", lwd = 2)
abline(v = sd(means), col="green", lwd = 2)



```


## Sampling Distribution 

In reality: 

***What we don't know:***

-   population mean 

***What we know:***

-   The sampling distribution is approximately normal
-   The standard error (standard deviation of the sampling distribution) can be estimated using the standard deviation of the sample:

<p style="text-align: center;">$StandardError = \frac{Sample SD}{\sqrt{n}}$</p>



## HW3 Guide

-   when you load the HW3.RData into RStudio, you will see the function `auto.sampler` in your Environment pane:

```{r}
load('HW3.RData')
```

<p style="text-align: center;">![](images/Screenshot 2023-09-17 at 17.21.03.png){width="900"}</p>

--------


### Q5 Guide

if you pass the only number within parentheses, it will give you one sample: 

```{r}
x = auto.sampler(10000)
```

Using this sample, write code in your HW 3.R script that will create: 

1. Histogram of this sample (`hist()` function)

2. Mean of this sample (`mean()` function)

3. Standard deviation of this sample (`sd()` function)

4. Standard deviation of the sampling distribution (_Hint: you will need `sqrt()` function_)

--------

### Q6, Q7, Q8 Guide

if you to get sample means for your four samples you need to write: 

```{r, eval = F}
means = auto.sampler(n=sample size, samples = number of samples)
```

replace `sample size` and `number of samples` with the ones that HW asks you to do.
